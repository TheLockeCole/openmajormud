# OpenMajorMUD
An open source re-implementation of the classic multi-user dungeon, MajorMUD. This will be developed by reverse engineering the last version released, 1.11p and rewriting the code in C (suitable for compiling with Borland C, Borland CBuilder, and likely Embarcadero CBuilder). The goal is to have a finished version that is documented, complete, and ready to be modified by interested individuals. 

Work will commense once function at a time, with an eye towards reproducing results (bugs and all) as the game was with its last version. As bugs are encountered, they will be documented so they can be fixed in a later fork that will continue with version 1.11r (1.11q will be, ideally, the finished replica of 1.11p).

As of 2016, MajorMUD is effectively abandonware.
